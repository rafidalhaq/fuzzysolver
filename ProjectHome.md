# Fuzzy-Solver #

Currently this application is designed to solve simple fuzzy logic tasks. Given a set of linguistic variables and a set of rules, it can create graphics of fuzzy functions and answer questions like "What is the probability of a car accident, if the traffic density is 13 cars per minute and current velocity is 30 km/h?"

This project's purpose originally was to vaildate manually calculated solutions for simple fuzzy logic tasks. Therefore it can handle tasks where fuzzy functions can be represented by two simple geometic figures: triangle and trapeze. Currenty tasks have to be implemented via Java classes, but providing base classes for exactly this purpose, this is a job that takes approximatly 10 minutes. There will be an option to keep fuzzy tasks persistent in future releases.

This project is open source.
